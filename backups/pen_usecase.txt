Should support writing
Ink should reduce when we write
Should support refill
Should not support write if there is no ink or the nib is broken

1. Figure out the entities

2. Figure out the methods

3. Relations b/w the entities

#Business Requirement Document

#Version 1.0



Create a system for real time monitoring of weather updates using our WeatherData object, which tracks current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure).
The system should support three display elements, 


1. The current conditions.
2. Weather statistics
3. Simple forecast
All updated in real time (as the WeatherData object acquires the most recent measurements)

The system should expose APIs for developers/systems who want to plug-in their owm displays.
